##The NBA team that had the highest salary is Cleveland. They had a much bigger total salary spending than the mean at above 120. Although Cleveland  had the highest salary spending, this did not translate to high points as Cleveland was fourth in the ranking and GSW was highest. However, Cleveland had the highest Cleveland total efficiency meaning they were getting bang for buck in terms of their efficiency. Interestingly, the team that scored the most points did not have the highest efficiency or the or the highest total salary. Ultimately, GSW won the NBA meaning that efficiency will not necessarily correlate with victories or overall success.
