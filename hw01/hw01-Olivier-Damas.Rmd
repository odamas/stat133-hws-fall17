# download RData file into your working directory
```{r}
# load data in your R session
load("/Users/macbookpro/stat133/stat133-hws-fall17/hw01/data/nba2017-salary-points.RData")
#head(player)
```



```{r}
salary <- salary/1000000
salary <- round(salary, digits=2)
salary
```

```{r}
experience <- replace(experience,  experience=="R" , 0)
experience 
as.numeric(experience)
class(experience)
typeof(experience)
```

```{r}
factor(position, labels = c("center","power_fwd","point_guard","small_fwd","shoot_guard"))
table(position)
```

```{r}
plot(points, salary, main ="Salary vs Points",ylab = "Salary in Millions",xlab ="Points")
``` 

```{r}
y <- sum(salary, na.rm = FALSE)/length(salary)
y
x <- sum(points, na.rm = FALSE)/length(points)
varx <- sum((points- x)^2)/(length(points)-1)
vary <- sum((salary- y)^2)/(length(salary)-1)
sdx <- varx ^0.5
sdy <- vary ^0.5
covxy <- sum((points- x)*(salary- x))/(length(salary)-1)
corxy <-(covxy)/ ((sdx)*(sdy))
corxy
gg<-cor(points,salary)
``` 


``

```{r}
b1 <- gg * (sdy/sdx)
b0 <- y - (b1*x)
b1
b0
Y <- b0 + b1*points
summary(Y)

``` 

`r Y <- b0 + b1*points` 


## Answer
Ultimatly how big the coefficient b1 gives the effect that points have on salary, and the positive sign indicates that as points increase salary increases. 






```{r}
 Y0 <- b0 + b1*0 
 Y0
Y100 <- b0 + b1*100 
Y100
Y500 <- b0 + b1*500
Y500
Y1000 <- b0 + b1*1000
Y1000 
Y2000 <- b0 + b1*2000 
Y2000
``` 
`r Y <- b0 + b1*0` 
`r Y <- b0 + b1*100` 
`r Y <- b0 + b1*500` 
`r Y <- b0 + b1*1000` 
`r Y <- b0 + b1*2000` 

```{r}
plot(points, salary, main ="Regression and Lowess lines",ylab = "Salary in Millions",xlab ="Points")
abline(b0,b1)

lines(lowess(points, salary))

text(2400, 30, "lowess", col = "red") 
text(2000, 15, "regression", col = "blue") 

``` 

```{r}
summary(salary-y)
TSS<- sum(salary-y)^2
RSS<- sum(salary-Y)^2
r2 <- 1 - RSS/TSS
r2
``` 



```{r}

plot(as.numeric(experience), salary, main ="Salary vs Years of Experience",ylab = "Salary in Millions",xlab ="Years of Experience")

lines(lowess(experience, salary))

``` 







```{r}
boxplot(salary ~position, main ="Salary vs Position",ylab = "Salary in Millions",xlab ="Position")
```

# from the scatterplot, experience does not seem to have an impact on salary. This is shown by the fact that players with higher years of experience were not receiving a greater salary than players with lower years of experience. This is shown by the relatively constant lows curve after the 5 year mark indicating that salary is not really changing as experience changes.
from the box plot, salary appears to be relatively constant as the median looks to be the same across the positions. For centers, however, the the third quartile and maximum and highest of all the positions indicating that they do get paid more.
Small forward offers a similar point of view but is not as dramatic as the center position.
8. Hardest part by far is uploading the document and loading the aspects. I thought graphing was relatively easy. I like the Data 8 Jupyter Notebook much better. About 5 hours. I did not get help. Loading the document took forever and is very frustrating, the rest is interesting.
